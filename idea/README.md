CyclotronAI 
Introduction : 
AI Chess Contest / Chess Wars for multiple players.

As the title says, the project is about running and hosting a worldwide AI chess wars contest which would also help boost and test the Azure platform as an EDtech and a business project, The platform will be built on Microsoft Azure with Kubernetes and AI deployment models with other rich features like web hosting and API as well, 

The Users will be given a dashboard on registration from the website with a unique ID for them, where they can upload their CHESS AI MODEL, Each player model plays chess against the other player model in rounds
10 GAMES PER SEC
Over a 15 min period each players get scores for the number of games they win, winning players move to the top leagues in a triangle with a winner and two runner-ups.
There will be a price of 1 million$ for the winners from my pockets.
It will attract a lot of programmers and attentation to your platform and is a very unique concept.

Kubernetes will be there to make the game fair as players might have bigger computers and it also limits the processing power and ram allowed to each player so the players will keep in mind to make optimized AI models

API will be used to send the next move to the game hosted on Microsoft Azure
Players will have a time limit to send the next move in a way that each player model plays 10 chess rounds per sec with the other in a 15 min round, the winning players move to the next round until we have a winner.

The website will be hosted on Microsoft Azure with separate Kubernetes for each player where they can deploy a single model
I will take part in the contest as-well

The competition will hold 1 million amazing people to start.
This solves ED tech and is a business opportunity for Microsoft as well as with this contest too I am sure the end reason is for Microsoft to introduce people to their platform so I think it is an as good idea as this contest itself.
We can add other details also
There will be rules for the chess game such as :
Rules so no player cannot cheat.
10 games/sec with 15 mins play with two players.
The losing player will be removed and the winning player will move to the next league with the winners and so on until there is a winner.

If i get sellected or not i am still going to host this game on my server.
